3\. _Modifications_. The customer may make changes to the software’s source code, compile those changes, and run changed versions of the software.

4\. _Billing_.

(a) _Invoices, Fees, and Payment_. The customer agrees to pay a fixed annual rate for self-hosted, self-maintained use. The customer agrees to pay the fees on the order, using the payment method on the order.

(b) _Billing Errors_. The customer agrees to give the vendor notice of any suspected billing error on an invoice before the deadline for payment. Both sides agree to resolve any potential billing errors promptly and in good faith. The customer agrees to pay the undisputed part of each invoice by the original deadline, and any part of the invoice resolved later within seven days of resolution.

5\. _Term and Termination_.

(iii) share copies of the software or documentation with with others not licensed under this agreement

8\. _Open Source_.

(a) _Open Source Compliance_. Some components of the software may be open source software available under free, public licenses. If the public license terms for any open source component conflict with the terms of this agreement, only the public license terms apply to that component, not the terms of this agreement. If the license terms for any open source component require an offer of source code or other information related to that component, the vendor agrees to provide on written request.

(c) _License Keys_. If the software requires license keys to function, the vendor agrees to give the customer those keys by e-mail within three days. If license keys for the software expire over time, the vendor agrees to give the customer new license keys by e-mail at least two weeks before the last keys expire. The customer agrees to share license keys only as required for use of the software as allowed under this this agreement, and to secure its license keys at least as well as its confidential business information.

12\. _Liability_.

(a) **_Disclaimer_**. **_Section 11 (Warranties) sets out the only warranties the vendor provides for the software. The vendor disclaims any warranties the law might otherwise imply, like warranties of merchantability, fitness for any particular purpose, title, or noninfringement._**

(c) **_Liability Cap_**. **_Except for Section 12(d) (Uncapped Liabilities), neither side’s total liability for breach of this agreement will exceed the amount of fees the vendor received from the customer under this agreement during the twelve months before the first claim is made. This limit applies even if the side liable is advised that the other may suffer damages, and even if the customer paid no fees at all._**

(d) _Uncapped Liabilities_. _Section 12(c) (Liability Cap)_ does not apply to:

(i) the customer’s obligations to pay fees

13\. _Indemnities_. These indemnities apply as long as the customer has paid all licensing fees as required by this agreement:

(e) _Indemnification Process_. Both sides agree that to receive indemnification under this agreement, they must give notice of any covered claim quickly, allow the other side to control investigation, defense, and settlement, and cooperate with those efforts. Both sides agree that if they fail to give notice of any covered claim quickly, indemnification will not cover amounts that could have been defended against or mitigated if notice had been given quickly. Both sides agree that if they take control of the defense and settlement of any covered claim, they will not agree to any settlements that admit fault or impose obligations on the other side without their signed, written permission.

(i) The developer may provide the customer a new version of the software that no longer infringes or breaks the law. That new version will be covered by this agreement. The customer will not pay any additional fee for the new version.

(ii) If the problem is infringement, the developer may get licenses for the customer so that the customer’s use of the software no longer infringes.

(iii) If the problem is illegality, the developer may get the approvals, licenses, or other requirements needed to abide by the law.
